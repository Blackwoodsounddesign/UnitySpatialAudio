/// Welcome to the docs for \b AudioFXToolkitDSP!<br> 
/// 
/// AudioFXToolkitDSP is the namespace holding the DSP (Digital Signal Processing Code). This has everything needed to start prototyping DSP ideas
/// inside of Unity. All that is needed for your own projects are the classes stored under AudioFXToolkitDSP.
/// The example usage scripts and the DemoResources are useful but are not essential. <br>
///
/// 
/// The algorithms included in this project are:
/// 
///     Two distortion algorithms,
///     a delay line with a number of implementations,
///     a biquad filtering suite, 
///     a onepole filter,
///     an allpass filter,                          
///     a feedback and feedfoward comb filter,                  
///     a sample peak/rms detector,                  
///     a wavetable,
///     a tremolo,
///     and a reverb (based on a schroeder reverb). 
/// 
/// All of this code has been tested and known to work. Change it at your own peril. <br>
///
/// These are preseted as building blocks for quickly protyping things in Unity. A good companion tool for this is Max/MSP.
/// Many of these algorithms can be thought of as objects in that language. Good companion texts can be found on the internet as well. <br>
/// 
/// These include:
/// 
///     DAFX (Digital Audio Effects)
///     The Computer Music Tutorial
///     The Theory and Techniques of Electronic Music
